There are Balls which are enemies moving from left to right at different speeds and sizes.

Some Balls have an inclined plane attached to it . If the player fall on it then the slope ball is
destroyed and player is projected along the normal of the plane.

There will be pond filled with water so that when the ball falls on the pond it goes inside
and can't jump unless it gets ground support.

It eventually drifts to the lowest point of the pond following circlular path.

After 1st level i.e in the 2nd level then appears the porcupine and the trampoline.
If u step on the porcupine then the player dies i.e no.of lives decreases.There are 3 lives in total.

In 3rd level the magnet appears for small amount of time and again appears for every level further.
Since the player is metal  it will experience a accerlation towards magnet.

Bonus-
    I have printed the Score, Level and Lives of the player on the screen using 7 segment Lines.
    I also implemented the zoom in/out using mouse scroll
    I move the porcupine as if it moves towards player.
    i.e it always moves towards player to kill it.
